== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1.How can i set background of text item transparent?
In field style of text item add : Example - background-color:rgba(55,55,55,0.1);

2.In admin area i can see only part of slides,images and texts. What am i doing wrong?
Probably in slides tab you choose to show only range of slides (links at the bottom). Texts and images depends on slides you choose. Number slides per page you can setup in cfg.php file.

3. Where can i setup my slider?
You can setup it in admin area and in cfg/cfg.php file (additional settings).

4.Can i add video from youtube?
Yes. But there is an important thing. If you add video, place it between  &lt;!--video--&gt; and &lt;!--*video--&gt;
You can add html code of video into template file and attach to slide as template element. Don't forget to setup width and height of element in plugin admin panel.

5. How can i made buttons?
You can made it through creating text element with apropriate classes or in template element.

6. How can i add pick color library?
In cfg.php file set $jquery_minicolors to true.
